Install MyBatis Migrations

  MyBatis Migrations is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed. Users need at least the
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Java Development Kit (JDK) is a plus.

  Additional optional installation steps are listed after the platform specific instructions.

* Windows 2000/XP

  [1] Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. mybatis-3.0.6-migrations.zip to the directory you wish
      to install MyBatis Migrations.
      These instructions assume you chose C:\Program Files\mybatis.
      The subdirectory mybatis-migrations-3.0.6 will be created from the archive.

  [2] Add the MIGRATIONS_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause), selecting the
      Advanced tab, and the Environment Variables button, then adding the MIGRATIONS_HOME variable in the user
      variables with the value C:\Program Files\mybatis\mybatis-migrations-3.0.6.
      Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces.

  [3] In the same dialog, add the MIGRATIONS environment variable in the user variables with the
      value %MIGRATIONS_HOME%\bin.

  [4] In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value
      %MIGRATIONS% to add MyBatis Migrations available in the command line.
